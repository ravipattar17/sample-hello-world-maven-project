web application will be accessible at the following URL:

http://<tomcat_server_ip>:<tomcat_port>/my-webapp/hello


Here, `` is the IP address of your Tomcat server, and `` is the port number on which Tomcat is running (usually 8080 by default).

Assuming your Tomcat server is running on the same machine as the web application, you can access the web page using the following URL:

http://localhost:8080/my-webapp/hello


Make sure to replace `` and `` with the actual IP address and port number of your Tomcat server.
